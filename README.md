# About
We believe that showing what our model is capable of doing is important. For this reason, we created a web application using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), where users can provide a repository URL, and we give the predictions for their CONTRIBUTING.md file. 

If you are interested in our application, give it a look at: http://contributing.info/ (Last time available: 08/10/2022).

This folder contains one of the first versions of our web application. Newer releases are being committed to: https://github.com/fronchetti/contributing.info/
