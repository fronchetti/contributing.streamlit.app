This model was implemented to investigate a bigger sample of projects without the need of a manual annotation of CONTRIBUTING.md files, and also to built a tool capable of reporting the quality of such files to project maintainers. Our future goal is to support maintainers on the implementation of better documentation files, and newcomers on finding essential information.")
