Researchers noticed that from the 9.514 projects selected for study, only 2.915 projects had a valid CONTRIBUTING.md file in their repository, about 30\% of the original dataset. Check out Table 1 for a complete overview of the selected projects.")

Our future goal is to support maintainers on the implementation of better CONTRIBUTING.md files, and newcomers on finding essential information.")
